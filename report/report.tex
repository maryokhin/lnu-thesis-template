\begin{abstract}
The report can have a summary or an abstract. An abstract is a more scientific way to
summarize the report. The abstract should be no longer than a paragraph, and is not
divided into more than one piece. In the abstract, you are answering the questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item In what context is the problem raised?
	\item What was the problem? Why is it iteresting and important to study this specific problem?
	\item What has been done to solve the problem?
	\item What is the result?
\end{itemize}

Sometimes the abstract is followed by some keywords, which are representative of the thesis area.

From reading the summary or the abstract the reader should clearly understand what the report is all about. It is often said that the title of the report then is a quick summary. That is the title of the report should also give a clear indication of what the report is about. If you have keywords is a good idea that the title contains a large proportion of these. Then you know you have an accurate title. In our data, scientific reports, we use the format of the abstract.\\

\textbf{Keywords:}
Thesis, report, template.

\chapter*{Preface}
You can have a preface in the paper if you want, but it is not necessary. In this you can write more personal reflections on report writing. An example would be why you yourself personally thought it was an interesting topic to write about or if you have experienced it particularly difficult or rewarding to write the report.

It is also in the preface you can take this opportunity to thank the people who have been particularly helpful during the report writing, for example, if you had any contact with a company that helped, those who have participated in interviews or questionnaires, if you received any funding from any or if you had someone who helped with proofreading.

The preface should not be long-winded, maximum half a page. Also note anonymity and confidentiality before you mention people by name. You can thank the people anyway, without typing their name.
